"""Build a pinned cam-IMU camera prior from several camera-only solves of the same rig.

Inputs and output are camera-only result dicts (`*_calib.yaml`): `median_prior` takes the
parsed YAMLs of several `mvis cam` solves of one rig and returns the per-camera median
intrinsics / distortion and the chordal-mean extrinsics, to be written as the pinned
camera prior of a cam-IMU config (the `cameras[].path` intrinsics file with
`free_intrinsics: false`); `per_camera_prior` does the same per camera group.
