"""Small ROS1 bag helpers shared by the bag rewriters (recalib tools and studies). No rosbags import:
they work on the reader, writer and message objects passed in.

Stamps are integer nanoseconds. The raw-byte helpers read and patch the header stamp of a
serialized ROS1 message whose first field is a ``std_msgs/Header`` (``seq`` uint32, then
``stamp.secs`` and ``stamp.nsecs`` uint32 at bytes 4-12) without deserialising it; shifting in
integer ns keeps every unshifted digit, where a float-seconds round trip near 1.7e9 s rounds
the stamp to about 0.24 us.
