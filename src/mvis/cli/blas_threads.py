"""Pin the BLAS thread count of the `mvis` command line to 1 (speed-up step T0).

Why
---
The cam-IMU and cam-only solves are per-factor Python on 3×3 / 2×N matrices;
numpy's bundled OpenBLAS still spins one worker per core on every matmul.  On
the T7 bag 2 C reference (S0b, 32 cores) that costs ~590 s of `sys` time per
solve for no wall-time gain (default threads: wall 333-336 s, sys ~590 s;
1 thread: wall the same within the load noise, sys 2-4 s), and it makes the
result depend on the thread count (two identical runs differ at <= 1e-13 with
32 threads and are bitwise equal with 1).  So the CLI pins one thread by
default: same wall time, half the CPU per solve (parallel regression batches),
reproducible results.

Where
-----
`mvis.cli.__init__` calls `pin_blas_threads()` as its first statement, which
runs before `mvis.cli.main` imports numpy / OpenCV / scipy (the console script
`mvis`, `python -m mvis.cli.main`, and the regression runner's subprocesses
all enter there).  OpenBLAS reads the variables when its library is loaded,
so the pin must precede the first numpy import — this module imports only the
standard library.

Only the CLI pins.  `import mvis` as a library leaves the environment alone:
the `mvis` package is used from notebooks and other programs whose thread
policy is theirs (and the golden test pins in-process through
`tests/_blas_threads.py` where it needs 1 thread).  When numpy, scipy or cv2
are already imported — a test importing `mvis.cli.main`, `recalib.roundtrip`'s
lazy import, an embedding program — the pin could not take effect any more
and is skipped without touching the environment.

Override
--------
`MVIS_BLAS_THREADS=<n>`  pin to n threads (set explicitly, it is applied even
                         when OPENBLAS/OMP/MKL_NUM_THREADS are exported — it
                         is the mvis-specific request).
`MVIS_BLAS_THREADS=0`    (or empty) do not pin: OpenBLAS keeps its default.
unset                    pin to 1 unless one of OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS,
                         GOTO_NUM_THREADS, OMP_NUM_THREADS or
                         MKL_NUM_THREADS is already exported: a value the
                         user set is never overridden (OpenBLAS honours
                         OMP_NUM_THREADS too, so an exported OMP value is a
                         thread choice even without OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS).

The variables set are OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS, OMP_NUM_THREADS and
MKL_NUM_THREADS (every BLAS a wheel may carry) and, with `setdefault`,
OPENBLAS_MAIN_FREE=1 (OpenBLAS must not change the main thread's CPU
affinity).  `mvis.cli.main` logs the outcome at INFO ("BLAS threads: …").
