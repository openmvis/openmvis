"""ROS1 message time from the serialized header, without deserialising the message.

Every stamped ROS1 message (Image, CompressedImage, Imu) starts with its std_msgs/Header:
seq (u32), stamp.sec (u32), stamp.nsec (u32). The camera-only readers and the cam-IMU
loader read the time from these bytes, so an out-of-window image is skipped before its
pixels are decoded, and a message whose stamp was never set (0) falls back to the bag's
record time instead of landing at t = 0.
