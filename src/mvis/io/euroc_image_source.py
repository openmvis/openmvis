"""EuRoC / ASL-format image source.

Reads image collections stored in the EuRoC convention::

    <cam_dir>/
        data.csv           # "#timestamp [ns],filename" header + rows
        data/
            <stamp>.png
            ...

Timestamps in the CSV are nanoseconds; they are converted to seconds
when yielded so downstream code (SLERP, trajectory alignment) can
stay unit-agnostic.

This is a sibling of ``TimestampedImageSource`` — we don't reuse that
class because its CSV order is ``filename,timestamp`` with no header,
which is NOT the EuRoC convention.
