"""One identity for a detection capture, shared by every detection cache.

``capture_key`` names WHICH frames were detected: the source, the camera topics (or image
dirs) in camera order, the time window and any reader knob that selects frames.
``board_fingerprint`` names HOW they were detected: the board's full scalar config. The
camera-only ``DetectionPipeline`` (``scripts/run_calibration.py``, ``mvis cam``) and the
cam-IMU loaders all key their cache on these two, so two runs that read different topics
or windows of one bag can no longer share (or overwrite) one cache entry.
