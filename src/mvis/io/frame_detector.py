"""Shared per-image detection front-end.

ONE place that turns a decoded image into board/feature observations, used by
BOTH the camera-calib detection pipeline and the cam-IMU loader. Wraps the
``Board.detect()`` contract (AprilGrid, ArUco, chessboard, and the geometry-free
``*_features`` detectors all implement it) into the canonical
``FrameObservations`` structure so the two pipelines see *identical* detections.

Also provides:
  * ``frames_to_arrays`` — adapt FrameObservations -> the cam-IMU pipeline's
    ``(t_cam, ids_list, uv_list)`` return shape (keeps that contract unchanged).
  * ``board_signature`` — re-exported from ``io.capture_key`` (its home since F4).
