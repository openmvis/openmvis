"""Calyx IMU intrinsic model: full 3x3 Dw, upper-tri Da, NO free rotation.

The gyro->IMU rotation is absorbed into the full (9-param) Dw during the solve
and recovered post-hoc by RQ decomposition (`decompose` -> R_wtoI · U_w), so the
model carries no separate SO(3) DOF (R_wtoI = R_atoI = I while optimizing).
