"""Allan deviation and static-span gravity from raw IMU streams (no solving).

Library helpers for characterising an IMU before calibration: `read_imu` loads a
EuRoC `imu0/data.csv`, `allan_dev` gives the overlapping Allan deviation of one axis
at the cluster times you pass, and `static_gravity` measures |g| over the static
seconds of a sequence. Use them to sanity-check the `imu.sigma_*` noise values of a
config against a static recording (see doc/estimate_config.md).
