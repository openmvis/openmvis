"""Single source of truth for the rolling-shutter vocabulary.

The two pipelines historically spelled the same concept differently:
- camera-only: ``CameraConfig.shutter_type`` — a string "global" | "rolling" |
  "auto" (RS enabled iff "rolling"; "auto" is treated as global).
- cam-IMU: ``pin_tr`` — a bool (True = global = pin the readout; False = rolling =
  estimate the readout) + ``rolling_mode`` (row convention: 0 top / 1 mid / 2 bottom).

These helpers define the correspondence in ONE place so both representations agree
(`"rolling"` ⟺ `not pin_tr`). No config restructure — both spellings stay; this just
removes the scattered ad-hoc ``== "rolling"`` / ``not pin_tr`` derivations.
