"""Hierarchical wall-clock timing for the calibration pipeline.

A ``Timer`` accumulates nested timing sections so the pipeline can record
not just per-stage totals but per-camera and per-sub-step breakdowns.
The intent is that every regression run produces actionable timing data
so we can answer questions like:

- "Is `top_left` actually 3× faster, or only 3× faster on Stage 4?"
- "For MIC, where does the wall-clock go — detection, Stage 4, or rerun?"
- "Does Stage 5 (rerun) earn its keep relative to its time cost?"

Design notes:

- **Single-threaded.** The calibration pipeline is sequential; we don't
  need locks, and overlapping ``with`` blocks are explicitly rejected
  rather than silently corrupting the call stack.
- **Cheap.** ``time.perf_counter`` deltas plus dict updates — well under
  a microsecond per ``section()`` call. Safe to wrap inner loops if
  needed.
- **No GTSAM/numpy coupling.** Pure Python so it can be unit-tested in
  isolation.
- **Optional metadata.** Each section can carry tags like
  ``n_observations`` or ``n_iterations`` so downstream analysis can
  compute normalised cost (s / 100k obs, s / iter, etc.).
