"""Export views: deployable artifacts rendered FROM the database.

The calib YAML (and later the Kalibr camchain) stop being things only the
solve can write: any solved run renders them via load-side mapping —
state(run_id) -> calibration_result_from_estimates -> the SAME OutputWriter
serialization the pipeline uses, so the export is guarded by construction
against drifting from the writer.

Known-lossy fields (documented, not silently wrong): per-camera `max` error
is not part of the persisted estimate and renders as 0. CameraParams.image_size
is not in the estimate either, but the capture's camera table stores each
stream's resolution (res_w/res_h), so the calib view restores it from there —
kb4's `valid_domain` (corner_radius_px, covers_image) is computed from it.
Only a capture without a stored resolution renders image_size as 0 (and those
two valid_domain fields as null); `normalise_calib_yaml_pair` documents how the
comparison treats that case.
