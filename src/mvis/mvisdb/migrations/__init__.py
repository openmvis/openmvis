"""Numbered, forward-only schema migrations.

Each migration is a module ``m<NNNN>_<slug>.py`` exposing ``VERSION: int`` and
``up(conn) -> None``. ``apply_migrations`` runs every migration with
``VERSION > schema_meta.schema_version`` in order, inside ONE transaction, then
bumps the version. A file whose version is HIGHER than the code's raises
``SchemaTooNewError`` (handled by the manager before this is called).
