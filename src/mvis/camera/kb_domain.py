"""Valid image domain of a theta-direct Kannala-Brandt fit (`KB_THETA_MODELS`).

theta_d(theta) is invertible only up to its first fold (d theta_d / d theta = 0;
pi when monotonic), so pixels beyond radius f * theta_d(fold) from (cx, cy) have
no ray. The polynomial is fit only inside the observed field, so a fold inside
the image is possible on a fit that is fine where it saw corners: it is
metadata and a warning, never a guardrail, and it does not stop a solve.
