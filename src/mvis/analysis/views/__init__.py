"""Canvas views for the reports and the sensor pages: the calibration process and the solved rig.

`spec` builds the data, `html` the markup, `assets/views.js` draws it. No Plotly or WebGL, so the views
print and load fast. One copy serves the MVIS reports and openmvis.com (`<report>_views.json`, no frames).
