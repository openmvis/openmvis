    Column 0 averages the heights (1/N), columns 1 and 2 take their first moments
    about the board x and y axes, normalised by the second moments so each row is in
    metres. Pinning W^T h to zero leaves the mean plane and tilt to the board pose and
    only the departure from that plane to the heights. Used by
