"""Multi-board cam-IMU initialization.

NOT purely PnP: PnP gives the board poses + camera-pose track; the cam-IMU state
comes from an inertial alignment (PnP cannot see the IMU). Stages:
  A. Anchor seed on board 0 — `initialize_cam_imu` on board 0's PnP pose track +
     raw IMU recovers T_CtoI, td, gravity, biases, per-keyframe IMU states/vels.
  B. Flip-robust per-board PnP tracks (multi-frame `pnp_pose_track`).
  C. Localize the other boards by INCREMENTAL co-visibility chaining: a board
     co-visible with ANY already-localized board is localized directly (robust
     average). Boards with no co-visibility chain fall back to the IMU bridge
     (propagate from the anchor) — without the IMU their relative pose is
     unobservable, so the bridge is what makes the non-co-visible case possible.
  D. Whole-bag IMU-state track from the localized boards' PnP (+ IMU velocities).
The joint LM solve then refines everything together.
