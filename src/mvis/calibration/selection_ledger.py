"""SelectionLedger: every permanent frame removal, recorded at the moment of
surgery.

The camera-only pipeline has 14 mutation sites expressed as list identity
destruction. Before any of them can become db flags, the flags must be
TRUTHFUL — so this ledger shadows the surgery first: each site records
(camera, timestamp, stage:reason) as it drops, and the run-attach step in
scripts/run_calibration.py folds the ledger into MVISDatabase frame flags
(is_selected_to_use=False + exclude_reason) before save. Solver inputs are
untouched; the overlay simply stops lying about what the solve used.

Step-1 scope: whole-frame removals from the joint solve stream only.
Stage-local subsets (init-frame selection, stage-2 hz thinning) are not
exclusions and are NOT recorded; observation-level drops (corner subsample,
outlier corners) come in a later step.
