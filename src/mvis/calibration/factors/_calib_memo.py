"""Per-camera calibration memo for the CameraCalib vision factors (a speed-up).

Every evaluation of a reprojection factor over the `CameraCalib` bundle
(`CameraCalibInterpFactor`, `CameraCalibImuFactor`, and the test-only
`tests/helpers/camera_calib_factor.CameraCalibFactor`) used to
rebuild the same per-frame fixed setup from `(base, xi)`:

    calib    = base.retract(xi)                     CameraCalib (Pose3.retract + canonicalize)
    proj     = make_projector(calib.model, calib.intr)   CameraModel + gtsam Cal3
    Ad_TCinv = calib.T.inverse().AdjointMap()       jac path only
    Jr_xiT   = se3_right_jacobian(xi[0:6])          jac path only

Within one LM pass every factor of a camera sees the SAME xi (one calib key per
camera), so the ~1500 factors of a camera build ~1500 identical setups per pass.
`get_calib_setup` keeps one entry per base object and returns it while the key
matches; the two jac-only pieces are built lazily on first use.

Placement (plan amendment 5): NOT an attribute on the mutable `CameraCalib`
(pickling / deepcopy under `--parallel`, the sensor-clock two-pass reuse, and
staleness if T / intr / td / tr / model change). A module-level
`WeakKeyDictionary` keyed by the base object holds `(key, setup)` where

    key = (id(base), xi bytes, base.intr bytes, base.T matrix bytes,
           base.td, base.tr, base.model)

is the complete input of the setup, so a mutated base or a different xi misses.
A reused `id()` after garbage collection is harmless: the other fields pin the
inputs, and equal inputs give the identical setup. A `base.copy()` is a new
object with its own entry.

Bitwise: a hit returns the objects a miss would have built from the same
inputs by the same deterministic calls, so the factor numbers are unchanged
(`tests/cam_imu/test_speedup_k2.py` proves it against frozen state-dump oracles with a
cold and a warm memo). The returned setup is shared between callers and must
be treated as read-only.

Threading: gtsam's `CustomFactor` callbacks run sequentially in the local
(non-TBB) build; a TBB build may interleave them. The entry is ONE tuple
written atomically per base, and the key is compared on read, so an
interleaved reader either gets a setup whose key equals its own inputs or
rebuilds (never a mix of two setups). The lazy jac pieces are idempotent
(two writers store equal arrays).
