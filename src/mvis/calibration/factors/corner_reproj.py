"""Shared corner bookkeeping of the three cam-IMU reprojection factors.

`CameraCalibInterpFactor`, `CameraCalibImuFactor` and `CameraFeatureInterpFactor`
each reproject a frame's corners and report per-corner error norms. What they
share lives here:

* `_row_offsets()`: the rolling-shutter row offset rho of each measured corner,
  from its image row (all three factors);
* `_lam(calib, i)`: the interpolation fraction of corner i between the two
  bracketing states, (dt_frame + td + rho_i tr) / dt (the two interpolated factors);
* `_pB(h)`: the frame's board points with the estimated heights added along the
  board normal (the two board factors);
* `corner_norms(*args)`: per-corner norms (px) from the factor's `_residuals`,
  NaN where a guard skipped the corner;
* `corner_norms_values(values)`: the same at a gtsam Values, through the
  factor's `args_from_values` (keys from make_factor);
* `corner_errors(*args)` / `corner_errors_values(values)`: the signed (u, v)
  errors (px) behind those norms, rows of NaN where a guard skipped the corner.
