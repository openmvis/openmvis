"""One place that builds `gtsam.LevenbergMarquardtParams` for the mvis solvers.

GTSAM semantics that the defaults below rely on (verified in
`tests/calibration/test_lm_convergence.py` against the installed wrapper):

* After every accepted iteration LM checks `relative_decrease <= relative_error_tol`
  OR `absolute_decrease <= absolute_error_tol` and stops on the first hit. The
  returned values are the last *accepted* iterate, so lowering the tolerances
  only ever appends extra iterations (or extra rejected lambda retries) to the
  same prefix — it never changes the iterate a run would have stopped at.
* Inside one iteration a rejected step multiplies lambda by `lambda_factor` (10)
  and retries until `lambda >= lambda_upper` ("giving up because cannot decrease
  error with maximum lambda"), or until the attempted cost change is below
  `relative_error_tol * current_cost` (then it stops searching at once).
* Every accepted iteration divides lambda by the factor, floored at
  `lambda_lower`.

The cam-imu-speedup L1 step (2026-10-31) moved the camera-only CLI tolerances
from 1e-10 to the GTSAM default 1e-5 and capped lambda at 1e2, so a converged
bundle no longer burns up to 15 rejected ~45 s retries before giving up. The
number of tries a genuinely stuck iteration makes is the number of decades
between the lambda at the stall and `lambda_upper`: 7 from GTSAM's initial
1e-5, 12 from the 1e-10 a run reaches after five accepted iterations (the
board_rep stalls had 15 tries: 1e-10 .. 1e4 at GTSAM's 1e5). The lower bound
is left at GTSAM's 0 by default: any positive floor changes the damping of
every later accepted step (~1e-11 relative on the ELP-L bag-3 bundle), while
0 keeps every accepted iterate bitwise; `lm_lambda_lower: 1e-6` in the yaml
trades that for a <= 8-try cap on late stalls.

Covered sites: `optimizer.Optimizer` (camera-only; the CLI and the
`pipeline_cam.PipelineConfig` paths both feed it), the three LM solves in
`pipeline_cam_imu` and `multi_board_pipeline` (through `_lm_params`). The
Dogleg path is untouched.

The cap also ends a solve LM cannot improve from a poor start, which looks like
convergence: see `lm_rescue`.
