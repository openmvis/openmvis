"""Per-camera count of what became of each corner, for all models. A diagnostic: it reads results
and feeds no metric or cost.

A corner whose projection fails drops out of the reprojection statistics, and in cam-IMU also out of
the cost (zero rows), so crossing the fold can silently lower a fit's error. Every corner the solve
was given lands in exactly one category:

    used            it had a factor in the final solve and projects at the final fit
    past_fold       it fails to project at the final fit, at or past a KB model's fold
    other_invalid   it fails to project at the final fit for any other reason, such as z <= 0 under
                    equidistant
    outliers        the outlier filter removed it and it still projects at the final fit
    no_pose_corners its frame reached no factor (no pose, too few points, outside the pose timeline),
                    or its pose was discarded after the solve; it was not judged
    not_in_solve    it never reached the final solve: thinned by rate or `corner_subsample`, or
                    dropped by a gate. The remainder, so it must not be negative

    detected = used + past_fold + other_invalid + outliers + no_pose_corners + not_in_solve

Beside those, not added to the sum: `n_corners` is used + past_fold + other_invalid; `filter_removed`
is what the outlier filter removed, so it matches `OutlierFilterStats` before minus after, and
`removed_invalid` is those that fail to project at the final fit; `discarded_pose_corners` is the part
of no_pose_corners that had a factor until final cleanup discarded the pose; `past_fold_pass1` is the
count of past_fold at pass 1's fit, for a fold the outlier rerun moved past them, and raises the alarm
too. A corner removed from a frame with no final pose is judged at its pass 1 pose, with the final fit.

`count_corners` is the one walk over camera-only corners. Cam-IMU walks its factors and classifies
through the same `CornerTally`.
