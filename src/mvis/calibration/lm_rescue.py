"""Rescue a solve that LM gave up on far from a minimum.

From a poor start, one frame can hold nearly all the cost. LM then rejects steps until lambda reaches
its cap and stops, and that stop looks like convergence. The signal is the undamped step from the stop:
stuck solves were predicted to lose 98-99 % of their cost, converged ones at most 2e-6 of it (7 digital
twins and the good seeds of a hard scenario, 2026-11-02), or 11 % with per-frame time offsets, whose flat
directions promise more than a real step delivers.

Diagonal damping from the same start avoids such a point, but it is not safe as the only damping: it hit
the iteration limit on the mvis_elp twin with a lever 10x worse. So it only runs after a stuck stop, normal
damping then finishes, and a solve that did not stop stuck is not touched. The result is only kept if
its cost is lower.
