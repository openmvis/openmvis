"""Two-phase camera-only solve schedule for one double_sphere or omni_radtan
camera (`solve_phased`).

omni_radtan:
  P1  k1, k2, p1, p2 held at the seed, xi under a sigma 1.0 prior at the seed,
      fx, fy, cx, cy and the board poses free;
  P2  xi held at the P1 value, everything else free (k1 of the Mei model and
      xi trade off, PMC11510980).

A single-camera fit therefore keeps xi at the P1 value unless pipeline Stage
2's diverged-pose reopt runs (that solve has xi free); a rig fits xi free in
Stage 4. A final free-xi stage was tried for #26 and dropped: with corners
below about 80 deg single-camera xi is weakly pinned, and on T265 cam1/07 a
free xi slid from 1.919 to 1.635 (Kalibr 1.900) with fx 835 -> 754 and k1
0.170 -> 0.003 at a 0.0025 px lower RMS.

double_sphere:
  P1  xi, alpha held at the seed (the canonical Usenko init), fx, fy, cx, cy
      and the board poses free;
  P2  everything free, warm-started from P1. xi / alpha can absorb fx; with
      no P1 anchor the solve escapes to a basin where xi flips positive and fx
      inflates about 2x (vs Usenko 2018 Table 3; found 2026-05-01).

P2 runs with the P1 optimizer's own options; omni_radtan only adds its camera
to `frozen_xi_cameras` (`phase2_options`). Earlier, pipeline Stage 2 rebuilt
the omni P2 options by hand and dropped `board_heights` / `board_height_sigma`,
so a board-shape solve lost the board shape in P2.

Used by pipeline Stage 2 (so `mvis cam` / `mvis run`) and by `mvis calibrate` (every camera of
a phased model, before its solve). Earlier, the CLI ran the omni
schedule only and solved double_sphere in one go.
