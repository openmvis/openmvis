"""Upload converted bags + dataset cards to the calibench Hugging Face repo.

Only datasets whose ``hosting_policy`` allows hosting are uploadable:
``host_both_formats`` (ours: .bag + .mcap side by side) and ``host_rosbag``
(CC BY third-party conversions and partner recordings hosted with
permission, ROS1 first). ``recipe_only`` datasets are refused — they are
reproduced via the exported recipes instead (see recipe_export.py).

Uploads shell out to the ``hf`` CLI (huggingface_hub is not a dependency of
the mvis env); pass ``runner`` to intercept in tests. Repo layout:

    converted/<dataset_key>/<sequence>[_<part>].bag|.mcap
    converted/<dataset_key>/<...>.provenance.json
    converted/<dataset_key>/README.md          # the dataset card
    recipes/SOURCES.md                         # attribution, regenerated per upload
