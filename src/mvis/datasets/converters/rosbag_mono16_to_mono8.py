"""ROS1 bag mono16→mono8 re-encode + header-clock re-stamp.

Fixes datasets (e.g. TUM-VI raw) whose bag-record time differs from the
header clock, and makes mono16 images detectable by the AprilGrid detector.
Pixels follow ``io.image_decode.mono16_to_mono8``, so the converted bag reads exactly
like the raw bag does in every MVIS reader.
