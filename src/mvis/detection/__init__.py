"""detection — the detection component.

Targets are data; detectors are algorithms:
  Board (mvis.detection.board, geometry)  <-  what db.boards stores
  FeatureDetector hierarchy        <-  the algorithms, composable by mode
  sweep(source, detectors, db)     <-  every frame, every enabled detector,
                                       filling the frozen measurement core

This package is the only home of targets and detectors; every call site
imports mvis.detection directly.
