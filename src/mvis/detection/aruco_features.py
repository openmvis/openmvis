"""ArUco tags as stable point features (geometry-free front-end).

Unlike :class:`ArucoBoard`, this does NOT assume a single rigid grid layout.
It emits every detected marker's 4 corners as :class:`Observation`s keyed by a
stable, globally-unique ``point_id = marker_id*4 + corner`` — with **no
``num_markers`` ceiling** and **no board 3D geometry**.

Use it when ArUco tags are scattered across several boards at unknown relative
poses and serve only as uniquely-ID'd features for feature-mode (target-free)
calibration: each corner becomes an independent 3D landmark, triangulated from
the trajectory rather than read off a known layout.

Data-association soundness relies on the marker IDs being globally unique across
all boards (verified for the virig_4imus_3cams ArUco captures: DICT_6X6_250,
IDs 1..53, no in-frame duplicates on any camera).
