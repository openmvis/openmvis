"""detection.boards — the component's target facade.

The geometry-full targets (AprilTag grid, ArUco grid, chessboard) and
`create_board`, re-exported from their implementation modules so that user code
can ``from mvis.detection.boards import create_board`` without knowing the
layout. Type new code against BoardGeometry (the target contract), not the
legacy Board.
