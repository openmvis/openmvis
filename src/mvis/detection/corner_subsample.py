"""Per-tag corner subsampling for AprilGrid observations.

Rationale
---------
An AprilGrid detection emits 4 corners per tag. Feeding all 4 into the
factor graph is accurate but slow; for regression and speed experiments
we sometimes want to keep only a subset (e.g. 1 corner per tag for a
~4x reduction in factor count).

The filter operates on already-detected ``Observation`` lists: the
detector still runs on the full image (it needs all 4 corners to decode
the tag), and the 3D board geometry is unchanged — only the measurement
set passed downstream is thinned.

Corner index convention (follows aprilgrid / ``AprilTagBoard``)::

    point_id = tag_idx * 4 + corner_idx

    corner_idx 0 = bottom-left   ("bl")
    corner_idx 1 = bottom-right  ("br")
    corner_idx 2 = top-right     ("tr")
    corner_idx 3 = top-left      ("tl", "top_left")

The labelling is *tag-intrinsic* — it follows the encoded bit pattern
on the tag face, so "top_left" means the same physical corner
regardless of how the board is rotated in the image.

Modes
-----
    "all"       — keep every observation (default; no-op).
    "top_left"  — keep only corner_idx == 3 (alias: "tl").
    "bl" / "br" / "tr" / "tl" — single named corner.
    "two_diag"  — keep corners 0 and 2 (bottom-left + top-right).
    "two_anti"  — keep corners 1 and 3 (bottom-right + top-left).
