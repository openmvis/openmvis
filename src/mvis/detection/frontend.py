"""FeatureFrontend — the contract feature-mode detection actually has.

The geometry-free feature detectors
(AprilTagFeatureDetector, ArucoFeatureDetector) used to subclass Board and
implement its geometry methods only to raise. Their REAL contract, as consumed
by every pipeline, is exactly this: detect a frame, and say how many points a
pose needs. 3-D for their features belongs to the run's landmarks,
never to a target.
