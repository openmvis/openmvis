"""sweep — stage ① of the run: every frame, every enabled
detector, filling the frozen measurement core of an MVISDatabase.

Contract:
  * frames are consumed IN TIME ORDER PER CAMERA (a future stateful
    FreeFeatureDetector depends on this — never parallelize per-frame);
  * one image in memory at a time (run_streaming's discipline);
  * the sweep writes ONLY measurements: frames, detection groups, detections.
    No caching (the manager's job), no subsampling (run policy, stage ②),
    no thumbnails (analysis').
