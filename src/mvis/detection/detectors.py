"""FeatureDetector hierarchy: the general detection classes.

The name history matters: the old base class `Board` conflated the physical
target with the detection algorithm — the geometry-free feature detectors
subclass it and RAISE on geometry access. Here the split is explicit:

  FeatureDetector           the algorithm contract: detect(image, t) per frame
  BoardFeatureDetector      wraps a geometry-full board target (AprilGrid,
                            ArUco grid, chessboard): known layout, PnP-able
  TagFeatureDetector        wraps the geometry-free *_features detectors:
                            ID'd corners, NO coplanarity assumed
  (FreeFeatureDetector)     future: anonymous tracks; STATEFUL — the sweep
                            feeds frames in time order per camera for it

Both wrappers delegate to the mvis.detection implementations so behavior is
byte-identical while call sites migrate.
